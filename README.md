# COVID-19 CT Scan Classification

Convolutional Neural Networks have had unprecedented use for a wide variety of tasks from computervision, natural language processing, and finance. In this project, we will use CNNs to explore the potential of using deep learning to diagnose the presence of Covid-19 in patients based on CT Images of their lungs.
